# HTMLoader

(I will write a better documentation later I promise :3)

1. Download the repo

2. Install ruby

3. Open `update.rb`

4. Open `server.rb`

5. Open an internet browser and go to `localhost:8000` (looks a bit broken on firefox)

To connect to the menu on a game console (may or may not work propperly depending on what you are using), follow steps 1-4, then:

5. Open cmd or powershell

6. Type in ipconfig

7. Go to the console's internet browser and enter your ipv4 address with a :8000 at the end: `<ipv4>:8000`

If you have any problems with it feel free to ask!
